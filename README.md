### Versioning
I am using semmantic versioning. No originality here just using the guidline found at https://semver.org/.  
In short this will mean Major will be big upates. Minor are any updates that arent too big and also arent backward compatitlbe. Lastely patches are simple fixes that are not required but might fixa little behavouir. Always should be backward compatible.
